# hello-world
I am soneone that, if you asked anyone that knew me while groing up, I was going to be a failure.  My father never taught me anything knowing I was a waste of time.  My mother showed love to everyoing else but me.  I know I was not deserving of her love.  My brothers and sisters knew they were better than me and I would cause shame.  I was destined to fail and become nothing.

My father was unavailable for a relation ship.  He was distant.  He was distant in many ways. First when I was 6 years old.  He moved away with to need to be a provider.  We were living in Ensenada and he needed to migrate to the states in ordere to maintain a more stady job that paid dollars.  He would come to visit everyother weekend.  Distance was still esistance when he was home.  I could hear his voice and his voice would give me comfort to know that he was home.  Very seldom he would direct his voice toward me.  If ever it was for me to do something. Or to yell at me because I did it wrong, I broke something or I spilled something.  A distante father is not a dad.

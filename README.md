# hello-world
My first repository
I am soneone that if you asked anyone that knew me while groing up, I was going to be failure.  My father never taught me anything knowing I was a waste of time.  My mother showed love to everyoing else but me.  I know I was not deserving of her love.  My brothers and sisters knew they were better than me and I would cause shame.  I was destined to fail and become nothing.
